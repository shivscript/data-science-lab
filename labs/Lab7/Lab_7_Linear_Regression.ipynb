    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Make sure you are familiar with:\n",
    "- Basic Python programming.\n",
    "- Concepts like correlation and variance.\n",
    "- Linear algebra (especially matrix operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Libraries\n",
    "We will use the following libraries:\n",
    "- `pandas` for data manipulation.\n",

    "### Introduction to Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is one of the most fundamental and widely used techniques in statistical modeling and machine learning. It is used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (response) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of a linear regression model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_n x_n + \\epsilon\n",
    "\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\\\( y \\\\): Dependent variable (target or response).\n",
    "- \\\\( \\beta_0 \\\\): Intercept (the value of \\( y \\) when all predictors are 0).\n",
    "- \\\\( \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_n \\\\): Regression coefficients that represent the impact of each predictor on the dependent variable.\n",
    "- \\\\( x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n \\\\): Independent variables (features or predictors).\n",
    "- \\\\( \\epsilon \\\\): Error term (captures the variation in \\\\( y \\\\) that the predictors cannot explain).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression can be categorized into two types:\n",
    "1. **Simple Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between a single independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between multiple independent variables and the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Assumptions of Linear Regression:\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between predictors and the target variable is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "4. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is widely used in various fields, including economics, engineering, biology, and social sciences, due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency for small to moderate-sized datasets.\n"

    "### **Question 1: Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "**Task:**  \n",
    "You have a dataset with two columns: `hours_studied` and `exam_score`. Develop a simple linear regression model to predict the `exam_score` based on the `hours_studied`.  \n",
    "**Sample data**\n",
    "data = {'hours_studied': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'exam_score': [50, 55, 60, 65, 70]}\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement simple linear regression using the normal equation:  \n",
    "   \\\\[ \\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y \\\\]\n",
    "2. Plot the regression line on a scatter plot.\n",
    "3. Calculate and plot the residuals (difference between actual and predicted values).\n",
    "4. Evaluate the model's performance by calculating the R-squared value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Add a column of ones to `X` for the intercept term.\n",
    "- Use `numpy.linalg.inv()` to compute the matrix inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 2: Multiple Linear Regression with Two Features**\n",
    "**Task:**  \n",
    "You have a dataset with three columns: `years_of_experience`, `education_level` (numerically coded), and `salary`. Develop a multiple linear regression model to predict the `salary` based on `years_of_experience` and `education_level`.  \n",

    "   \\\\[ \\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y \\\\]\n",
    "2. Plot a 3D regression surface showing how salary is predicted by `years_of_experience` and `education_level`.\n",
    "3. Plot the residuals for this model.\n",
    "4. Interpret the coefficients to understand the effect of `years_of_experience` and `education_level` on `salary`.\n",

    "You have a dataset with the following columns: `age`, `income`, `num_of_children`, and `monthly_spend`. The goal is to predict `monthly_spend`. Before building the regression model, perform the necessary data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables (if any).  \n",

    "4. Visualize the residuals to check the model’s assumptions.\n",
